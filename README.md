AI Assignments includes supervised and unsupervised learning, transfomers, LLM, prompt engineering, AI app.

Assignment 1: Supervised Learning with the Iris Dataset
This assignment aims to help us understand and apply the principles of supervised learning using a simple dataset. 
We will practice data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.


Assignment 2: Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering
This assignment aims to help us understand and apply the principles of unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
We will work with the Iris dataset to cluster and evaluate the results.


Assignment 3: Implement the Transformer.

# AI-Launchpad
AI Assignments include supervised and unsupervised learning, transformers, LLM, prompt engineering, and AI apps.

Day 1
Assignment 1: Supervised Learning with the Iris Dataset
This assignment aims to help us understand and apply the principles of supervised learning using a simple dataset. 
We will practice data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.


Assignment 2: Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering
This assignment aims to help us understand and apply the principles of unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
We will work with the Iris dataset to cluster and evaluate the results.

Day 2
Assignment 1: Implement the Transformer.
This implementation serves as a starting point for exploring Transformer models and their capabilities

Assignment 2: Large_Language_Models_(LLMs)
The Hugging Face Transformers library will create an example using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language processing tasks. 
A step-by-step guide on implementing text generation using GPT-2 in Google Colab is provided.

Assignment 3: QA_Context_Prompt_Engineering
In this lesson, you'll practice two prompting principles and their tactics to write effective prompts for large language models.

Day 3
Assignment 1: QA_Assistant
We aim to create a QA Assistant app, similar to ChatGPT, to streamline and enhance the QA process.
